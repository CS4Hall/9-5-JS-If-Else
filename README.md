## Directions

### Step #1 - Show the answer! <br>

In this challenge, you'll make a flash card. You'll display the answer when the mouse is pressed, and the question when it isn't.
<br><br>
For the first step, adjust the code to display the riddle's answer when the mouse is pressed. Otherwise, display the riddle.
<br><br>
_Hint:_
<br>
`if(......){`<br>` text("..", .., ..);`<br>` }`<br>
`else{`<br>` text("..", .., ..);`<br>` }`

### Step #2 - Play! <br>

For those who finish early, challenge yourselves to add the ability to display a second riddle/answer set. There are many ways to approach this. Consider using a variable to store the current riddle number as one possible solution.
